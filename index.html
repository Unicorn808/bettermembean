    <h3>Stuff Stuff</h3>
    <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and
        without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also
        Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws
        heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the
        intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny-
        they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course
        they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"
        which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just
        imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit
        unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ðŸ˜‚
        And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only-
        and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
        Nothin personnel kid ðŸ˜Ž</p>

        <h3>Cool Stuff</h3>
        <p>Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear
            me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.
            Here's why:
            Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys
            had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.
            Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its
            Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You
            aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.
            Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall,
            flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.
            And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have
            spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters
            over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control
            means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.
            Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they
            can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is
            faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?
            Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.
            Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning
            Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think
            Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after
            something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be
            0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have
            some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.
            I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since
            he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away,
            and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:
            "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."
            And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.</p>

    <h3>Other Stuff</h3>
    <p>I'm Harambe, and this is my zoo enclosure. I work here with my zoo keeper and my friend, cecil the lion.
        Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know WHO is gonna
        come over that fence.</p>

        <h3>More Stuff</h3>
        <p>Many people always ask me how I was able to get into Harvard as a 16 year old who skipped 3 grades of high
            school. They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview.
            As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks
            me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a
            child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different
            languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated
            my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA."
            Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the
            application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I
            said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and
            said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible
            gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then
            suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a
            diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)</p>
